Background: ctDNA-based post-surgical detection of molecular residual 
disease (MRD) is known to be predictive of a high risk of recurrence. 
Here, we report the first results of BESPOKE CRC, a multicenter, 
prospective, observational study evaluating the ability of a 
tumor-informed ctDNA assay to inform ACT treatment decisions in stage 
II/III CRC patients (pts). Methods: Of the 1792 pts enrolled between 
2020-07-02 and 2022-08-25, plasma samples from the first 350 pts with 
stage II-III CRC were analyzed. ctDNA was detected and quantified using a 
personalized, tumor-informed assay (Signatera, Natera, Inc.). Following 
curative resection, 232 pts received ACT and 118 underwent observation. 
Results: The cohort included 154 stage II and 196 stage III CRC pts; the 
median follow-up was 24.8 months. ctDNA results at the post-op MRD time 
point (tp) were available for 295 pts; 15.6% (46/295; stage II: 
9/130=6.9%; stage III: 37/165=22.4%) of pts were ctDNA positive (ctDNA+) 
at MRD tp (MRD+). MRD-positivity was significantly associated with 
inferior disease-free survival (DFS) in stages II-III combined (HR=20.8, 
95% CI: 10.0-43.4, p,0.0001) and in stage-stratified subgroups (stage II: 
HR=25.7, 95% CI 6.8-96.7; stage III: HR=18.1, 95% CI 7.3-45.1). Within the 
MRD+ group, pts receiving ACT had longer DFS compared to those in the 
observation group (median DFS: 18.7 vs 6.7 months; HR=3.9, 95% CI: 
1.3-11.5, p=0.01). In contrast, no benefit of ACT was observed in MRD- pts 
(HR=1.1, 95% CI: 0.3-3.9, p=0.89). Of the MRD+ pts, 39.1% (18/46) had 
ctDNA clearance at 12-weeks post-surgery tp. Pts with ctDNA clearance had 
longer DFS compared to those who remained positive (median DFS: 24.2 vs 
13.8 months; HR=0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.0,p=0.045), however, had worse DFS than 
pts who were ctDNA- at both 4- and 12-weeks (HR=22.5, 95% CI: 6.8-75.0, 
p,0.0001). Notably, 44.4% (8/18) pts with ctDNA clearance recurred; all 8 
turned back ctDNA+ before radiological detection of relapse. ctDNA results 
during surveillance were available for 339 pts, of whom 8.3% (58/339) were 
ctDNA+ and had significantly worse DFS compared to serially ctDNA- pts 
(HR=124.3, 95% CI: 29.8-518.7,p,0.0001). Conclusions: ctDNA-based MRD 
detection of MRD was highly prognostic of recurrence in an early 
representative subset of BESPOKE CRC cohort. Data from the expanded cohort 
will be presented at the meeting. ctDNA MRD results were also predictive: 
significant benefit from ACT was observed in MRD+ but not in MRD- pts. 
Additionally, early ctDNA clearance in response to adjuvant therapy and 
ctDNA status during surveillance were prognostic of pt outcomes. Our 
results highlight the potential utility of ctDNA-guided adjuvant therapy 
in pts with stage II/III CRC. The results of BESPOKE CRC herein, as one of 
the first ctDNA-based prospective studies, will be further validated by 
ongoing ctDNA-directed randomized clinical trials. Clinical trial 
information: NCT04264702. Research Sponsor: None.
